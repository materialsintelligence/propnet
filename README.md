# Propnet

Propnet is a knowledge graph for materials science. Given a set of *properties* about a given material, it can try to derive additional properties of that material using *models*. It is intended to integrated closely with the [Materials Project](http://materialsproject.org) and its large database of materials properties.

Propnet can also be used as a library, each model can be imported and used directly in your own code, giving you tested, unit-aware implementations of common materials science models.

See [propnet.materialsproject.org](https://propnet.materialsproject.org) for a web app based on the package.
