# WEBSITE OUTAGE
The local electric utility company is again performing a Public Safety Power Shutoff in the region of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, where our web server is hosted. As a result, the website will be offline until at least Monday, October 28. Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause. 

# Propnet

Propnet is a knowledge graph for materials science. Given a set of *properties* about a given material, it can try to derive additional properties of that material using *models*. It is intended to integrate closely with the [Materials Project](http://materialsproject.org) and its large database of materials properties. However, it is designed to be agnostic to the data source, with support for other open-source databases planned.

Propnet can also be used as a library, each model can be imported and used directly in your own code, giving you tested, unit-aware implementations of common materials science models.

See [propnet.lbl.gov](https://propnet.lbl.gov) for a web app based on the package.

For usage information, it is currently best to view our example Binder notebook, linked below. We do have a documentation website under construction at [propnet.readthedocs.io](https://propnet.readthedocs.io).
