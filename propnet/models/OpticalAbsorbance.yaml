Absorbance A quantifies the reduction of light intensity as it passes through the material,
i.e. I = I_0(1 - R - A), where I_0 is the intensity at the surface and I is the intensity of
the light that comes out. R is the reflectance, which is the proportion of the reflected light
at the interface.

Frequency-dependent absorption coefficient alpha models the rate of the exponential decay of
intensity as the light passes through medium, and is derived from the extinction coefficient k.
