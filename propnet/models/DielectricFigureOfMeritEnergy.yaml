Relation from Yim, K. et al. Novel high-κ dielectrics for next-generation electronic devices
screened by automated ab initio calculations. NPG Asia Mater. 7, e190 (2015).

Gives an indication as to the fitness of the dielectric for use in a capacitor.

Balances the resistance of the dielectric to leakage current as well as the increase in
energy density afforded by the linear response.
