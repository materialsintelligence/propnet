description: 'Absorbance A quantifies the reduction of light intensity as it passes

  through the material, i.e. I = I_0(1 - R - A), where I_0 is the intensity

  at the surface and I is the intensity of the light that comes out. R is

  the reflectance, which is the proportion of the reflected light at the interface.


  Frequency-dependent absorption coefficient alpha models the rate of the

  exponential decay of intensity as the light passes through medium, and

  is derived from the extinction coefficient k.
