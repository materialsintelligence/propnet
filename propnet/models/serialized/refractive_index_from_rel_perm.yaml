description: 'The refractive index gives the factor by which the speed of light is
  reduced in

  a medium.  Likewise, modeling the induced magnetic and electric dipoles as linear

  within a material, a relative spatial electrical permittivity and relative spatial

  magnetic permeability arise from consideration of the total electrical and magnetic

  fields.


  From the Maxwell Relations, the index of refraction is equal to the geometric mean

  of the relative permittivity and the relative permeability.
