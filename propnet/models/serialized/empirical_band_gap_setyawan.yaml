    Band gaps estimated using Density Functional Theory (and the PBE exchange-correlation
    functional) typically underestimate the true band gap. A linear least squares fit
    can provide an estimate of the true band gap from the PBE gap (R\xB2 = 0.886 when tested
    against 100 compounds with gaps between ~1 and ~12 eV).
