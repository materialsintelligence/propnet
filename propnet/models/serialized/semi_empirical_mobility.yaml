description: 'The electron mobility is difficult to model purely from first principles.


  This is a semi-empirical model to approximate the electron mobility based

  on the bulk modulus and the electron effective mass - two quantities that

  are readily accessible from first-principles calculations.


  The accuracy for band conductors is typically within half an order of magnitude.
