description: "Based on the model posited in https://doi.org/10.1016/S0257-8972(02)00593-5,
this relation predicts the thermal conductivity of materials in the high temperature limit.
Materials that have smaller values of Clarke thermal conductivity should be expected to
have smaller thermal conductivity at high temperatures.

In particular, this model predicts that a material will have low thermal conductivity at
high temperatures if it has the following broad characteristics.

1) A large molecular weight
2) A complex crystal structure
3) Non-directional bonding
4) A large number of different atoms per molecule"
