  The Wiedemann-Franz Law states that the ratio of the
  electronic component of thermal conductivity to electrical
  conductivity is proportional to temperature.

  This model is based on the application of the drude model, using
  predictions from the kinetic model of an ideal gas. Thus, the
  Wiedemann-Franz Law is only widely applicable to metallic solids.

  In general the WFL constant (2.45E-8) may vary between metals due
  to deviations from the free electron model. In particular, there
  may be significant deviations from this model at intermediate
  temperatures, whereas strong agreement has been observed at
  both low and high temperatures.

  Strongly correlated systems can also exhibit substantial deviations
  from this relation where heat and charge transfer become decoupled.
