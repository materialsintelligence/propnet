description: 'The Wiedemann-Franz Law states that the ratio of the

  electronic component of thermal conductivity to electrical

  conductivity is proportional to temperature.


  This model is based on the application of the drude model, using

  predictions from the kinetic model of an ideal gas. Thus, the

  Wiedemann-Franz Law is only widely applicable to metallic solids.


  In general the WFL constant (2.45E-8) may vary between metals due

  to deviations from the free electron model. In particular, there

  may be significant deviations from this model at intermediate

  temperatures, whereas strong agreement has been observed at

  both low and high temperatures.


  Strongly correlated systems can also exhibit substantial deviations

  from this relation where heat and charge transfer become decoupled.
