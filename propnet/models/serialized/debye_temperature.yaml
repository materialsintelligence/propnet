description: 'Assuming a linear dispersion relationship between angular frequency
  and

  wave number along with a free particle k-vector density of states, the

  Debye model is a highly-effective estimate of low-temperature heat capacity.


  Using the grand canonical ensemble, the model correctly predicts the transition

  from increasing heat capacity at low temperatures to roughly constant heat

  capacity at high temperatures (Dulong P\xE9tit rule). This transition occurs

  roughly at the Debye temperature.


  The Debye temperature can be shown to depend only on fundamental constants,

  density of the material, and the effective sound velocity in the material.

  The effective sound velocity is in turn related to the material''s bulk modulus.


  At intermediate temperatures, especially those around the debye temperature,

  deviations in heat capacity may occur due to a breakdown in the linearity

  of the dispersion relationship for real materials.
