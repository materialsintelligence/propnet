  An expression for the Gruneisen constants of solids is obtained
  involving only the velocities of propagation of the elastic waves.
  The new relation is applied for determining the Gr√ºneisen constants
  of metals, ionic crystals, and ionic-molecular crystals.
equations:
  - gamma_d - 1.5 * ((3*(v_l / v_t)**2 - 4) / ((v_l / v_t)**2 + 2))
