Assuming a linear dispersion relationship between angular frequency and
wave number along with a free particle k-vector density of states, the
Debye model is a highly-effective estimate of low-temperature heat capacity.

Using the grand canonical ensemble, the model correctly predicts the transition
from increasing heat capacity at low temperatures to roughly constant heat
capacity at high temperatures (Dulong Pétit rule). This transition occurs
roughly at the Debye temperature.

The Debye temperature can be shown to depend only on fundamental constants,
density of the material, and the effective sound velocity in the material.
The effective sound velocity is in turn related to the material's bulk modulus.

At intermediate temperatures, especially those around the debye temperature,
deviations in heat capacity may occur due to a breakdown in the linearity
of the dispersion relationship for real materials.

This model currently uses the implementation in pymatgen.
