When light passes through a medium, some part of it will always be attenuated.
This can be conveniently taken into account by defining a complex refractive index.

Both real and imaginary parts of the refractive index can be derived from the
complex permittivity epsilon. This implementaiton assumes that magnetic permeability \mu is 1
